## Problem 1

Import & Filter Data

``` r
homicide_df = 
  read_csv("./data/homicide-data.csv", na = c("", "NA", "Unknown")) %>% 
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = "_"),
    resolution = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ 0,
      disposition == "Open/No arrest"        ~ 0,
      disposition == "Closed by arrest"      ~ 1,
    ),
    victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age)
  ) %>% 
  filter(!city_state %in% c("Tulsa_AL", "Dallas_TX", "Phoenix_AZ","Kansas City_MO"))  %>% 
  filter(victim_race %in% c("Black", "White")) %>% 
  filter(victim_sex %in% c("Male", "Female")) %>%  
  select(city_state, resolution, victim_age, victim_race, victim_sex)
```

#### Fit a logistic regression in Baltimore\_MD

``` r
baltimore_logitstic = homicide_df %>% 
  filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>% 
glm(resolution ~ victim_age + victim_sex + victim_race, family = binomial() , data = .) %>%
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  mutate(
    odds_ratio = exp(estimate),
    ci_lower =  exp(estimate - 1.96 * std.error),
    ci_upper = exp(estimate + 1.96 * std.error)
  ) %>% 
  select(term, odds_ratio, starts_with("CI")) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 3)
```

#### Fit a logistic regression on all the cities

``` r
models_results = homicide_df %>% 
  mutate(victim_race = fct_relevel(victim_race, "White")) %>% #reordering to compare black victims to white victims
  nest(data = -city_state) %>% 
  mutate(
    models = map(.x = data, ~ glm(resolution ~ victim_age + victim_sex + victim_race, data = .x, family = binomial())),
    results = map(models, broom::tidy)
  ) %>% 
  select(city_state, results) %>% 
  unnest(results) %>% 
  mutate(
    odds_ratio = exp(estimate),
    ci_lower =  exp(estimate - 1.96 * std.error),
    ci_upper = exp(estimate + 1.96 * std.error)
  ) %>% 
  select(term, odds_ratio, starts_with("CI"))
```

#### Plot the estimated Odds Ratios and CIs for each city

``` r
models_results %>% 
  filter(term == "victim_sexMale") %>% 
  mutate(city_state = fct_reorder(city_state, odds_ratio)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = city_state, y = odds_ratio)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = ci_lower, ymax = ci_upper)) +
 theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, vjust = 1.0, hjust = 1), legend.position = "none") + 
 geom_hline(yintercept=1, linetype="dashed", color = "red", size=0.5) +
  labs(
    title = "Odds Ratio of case Resolution Status, by City",
    subtitle  = "Comparing whether a homicide case is resolved for male Black victims to White victims, by City",
    x = "Odds Ratio",
    y = "City-States"
  )  
```

![](p8105_hw6_by2287_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png)<!-- -->

The estimated odds of a homicide case being resolved for male Black
victims compared to the estimated odds of a homicide case being resolved
for White victims is lowest is New York City, NY (with evidence of
statistical significance); and highest in Albuquerque New Mexico,
although this is not statistical significant. The former observation
means that in New York City (as well as Baton Rouge, Louisiana; Omaha,
Nebraska; Chicago, Illinois, and others whose Odds Ratio & and their 95%
confidence interval is well below the dashed red line), if the homicide
victims are Black, the likelihood that that case will be resolved is
lower than if they were a white victim. However, this observation
doesn’t hold true in Boston, MA, Tampa, Florida, Atlanta, Georgia and
other city-states whose odds ration and 95% confidence interval either
crosses or is above the null value of odds ratio = 1 (indicated by the
dashed red line.)

## Problem 2

``` r
baby_df = 
  read_csv("./data/birthweight.csv") %>%
  mutate(
    babysex = ifelse(babysex == 1, "male", "female") %>% as.factor(),
    frace = 
      case_when(
        frace == 1 ~ "White",
        frace == 2 ~ "Black",
        frace == 3 ~ "Asian",
        frace == 4 ~ "Puerto Rican",
        frace == 8 ~ "Other",
        frace == 9 ~ "Unknown",
        TRUE ~ ""
      ) %>% as.factor(),
    mrace = 
      case_when(
        mrace == 1 ~ "White",
        mrace == 2 ~ "Black",
        mrace == 3 ~ "Asian",
        mrace == 4 ~ "Puerto Rican",
        mrace == 8 ~ "Other",
        TRUE ~ ""
      ) %>% as.factor(),
    delwt = delwt*453.592 %>% round(2),
    mheight = mheight*2.54 %>% round(2)
  )
```

Tidying steps:

  - 1 Convert `babysex` to a `factor`
  - 2 Label Father’s race, and convert to `factor`
  - 3 Label Mother’s race, and convert to `factor`
  - 4 Convert Mother’s weight at delivery to `grams` to keep it
    consistent with baby’s `birthweight`
  - 5 Convert Mother’s height to `centimeters` to keep it consistent
    with baby’s length at birth

None of the variables contain missing values

#### Proposing an initial model for birthweight

Hypothesis driving proposed model:

An infant’s overall health depends on the overall health status of the
mother and the mother’s physical ability (without considering
sociodemographic factors) play important roles in determining the baby’s
health, and indeed the baby’s birthweight. I will treat three factors as
proxies of the mother’s health status and physical ability: mother’s
weight, height, and age.

Therefore, I hypothesize that a baby’s birhtweight can be explained by a
linear relationship to a mother’s weight, adjusting for height and age.
I propose to build a linear models that attemps to describe this
relationship.

First, I will assess the linearity and normality assumption a `linear`
model makes.

**Normality Assumption** Plot the distribution of our outcome variable -
`birthweight`

``` r
baby_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = bwt)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5) + 
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of Babys' birthweight",
    y = "Count",
    x = "Birthweight (in grams)"
  )
```

![](p8105_hw6_by2287_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png)<!-- --> The
histogram of a baby birthweight in the data follows a normal
distribution as shown above.

I will next assess the linearity assumption by plotting a scatter plot
between the outcome variable `birthweight` and these three proposed
predictors.

**Linearity Assumption**

``` r
bwt_delwt = baby_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = bwt, y = delwt)) + 
  geom_smooth(se = F) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.1) + 
    labs(
    title = "Relationship between Birthweight and Mother's Weight at Delivery ",
    y = "Weight(grams)",
    x = "Birthweight (in grams)"
  )

bwt_mheight = baby_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = bwt, y = mheight)) + 
  geom_smooth(se = F) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.1) + 
  labs(
    title = "Relationship between Birthweight and Mother's Height at Delivery ",
    y = "Height(cms)",
    x = "Birthweight (in grams)"
  )


bwt_momage = baby_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = bwt, y = momage)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.1) + 
  geom_smooth(se = F) + 
    labs(
    title = "Linear relationship between Birthweight and Mother's Age",
    y = "Age (years)",
    x = "Birthweight(in grams)"
  )


bwt_delwt / bwt_mheight / bwt_momage 
```

![](p8105_hw6_by2287_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png)<!-- -->

In assessing the linearity assumption between birth-weight and both
mother’s `weight` and & `height`, we see that there is a slight curve
around 2000-2500 grams of a baby’s birth-weight. But perhaps it could be
argued both relationship are mostly linear. The relationship between
birth-weight and mother’s age, also appears to be mostly linear, with
birth-weight increasing with an increase in mother’s age. Here, I will
assume a linear relationship exists and will move forward to build a
linear model.

#### Fitting the proposed Initial model

The residuals appear to be evenly distributed for the most part, save
for what appears to be a cluster at weight range 3000 - 3250 grams.

#### Building two additional models with different predictors & compare to the initial model:

Two models:

One using length at birth and gestational age as predictors (main
effects only) One using head circumference, length, sex, and all
interactions (including the three-way interaction) between these

``` r

1st: Create cross validation datasets, by splitting the original sample
into 80% for training and 20% for testing, and creating 100 `resample`
object.

``` r
cv_df = 
  crossv_mc(baby_df, 100)

#Convert the resample objects into a tibble
cv_df = cv_df %>% 
  mutate(
    train = map(train, as_tibble),
    test = map(test, as_tibble) 
    ) 
```

Fit the 3 models to be compared on the training datasets and compute the
RMSE values of the corresponding models

``` r
cv_df = cv_df %>% 
  mutate(
    model_1 = map(.x = train, ~lm(bwt ~ delwt + mheight + momage, data = .x)),
    model_2 = map(.x = train, ~ lm(bwt ~ blength + gaweeks, data = .x)),
    model_3 = map(.x = train, ~ lm(bwt ~ bhead + blength + babysex + bhead*blength*babysex, data = .x))
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    rmse_model_1 = map2_dbl(.x = model_1, .y = test, ~rmse(model = .x, data =.y)),
    rmse_model_2 = map2_dbl(.x = model_2, .y = test, ~rmse(model = .x, data =.y)),
    rmse_model_3 = map2_dbl(.x = model_3, .y = test, ~rmse(model = .x, data =.y))
  ) 
```

Compare RMSE’s of the `smooth` and `linear` model

``` r
#tidy the cross_validation dataframe first
rmse_df = cv_df %>% 
  select(starts_with("rmse")) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    everything(),
    names_to = "model",
    values_to = "rmse",
    names_prefix =  "rmse_"
  ) 

#Outputs the mean RMSE values in a table
rmse_df %>% 
  group_by(model) %>% 
  summarize(
    mean_rmse = mean(rmse)
  ) %>% 
  knitr::kable()

Of the 3 models built here the 3rd model (`bwt ~ bhead + blength +
babysex + bhead*blength*babysex`) appears to be the best model to
predict `birthweight`, using RMSE as a discriminator.

```

The 95% confidence interval for the log of the product of the estimated
slope and intercept: log(beta\_0∗beta\_tmin).

``` r
parameter_distb %>% 
  summarize(
    ci_lower = quantile(log_b0_b1, 0.025), 
    ci_upper = quantile(log_b0_b1, 0.975)  
  ) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 4)
```

| ci\_lower | ci\_upper |
| --------: | --------: |
|    1.9669 |    2.0585 |

``` r

The Log(beta\_o\*beta\_tmin) values i.e., the distribution of the log of
the product of the estimated intercept and estimated coefficient we
obtained from the `bootstrap` technique also appear to be normally
distributed.
